Helen MacDonald - Group Fitness Instructor

 Personal Trainer, Fitness Instructor, Nutrition, Run and Life Coach.   With over 20 years working in the Health and Wellness industry as a Personal Trainer, Run Coach and Fitness Instructor ,I’ve gained a lot of experience both personally and professionally! My personal experiences include competing at the Provincial Level of Body Building placing 2nd in my category. I’ve competed in several Triathlons too . My most proudest accomplishments were running the 2017 Chicago Marathon for the Leukaemia and Lymphoma Society of Atlantic Canada and finishing The 2019 Boston Marathon! These pivotal events have shown me what determination and perseverance will do for one’s Health!  My personal accomplishments have not only shaped me into the individual I am today but also given my clients the tenacity to keep going when they wanted to give up! I’ve been told that my inspiring nature is what motivates others to do better with their health!   My experiences over the years extends beyond my professional accomplishments to being a mother of  2 girls and now a woman in my  50’s navigating the empty nest and the changes that age can bring! Being relatable to my clients is so very important to me. I love connecting and with others, meeting them  where they currently are on their journey to improving their health! I love to help others move forward  beyond their hardships and limitations to fall in LOVE with their  LIFE!   My knowledge and experience encompasses more than being a Fitness Instructor and Personal Trainer having spent a good part of the last 10 years working as a Nutrition Coach improving  many lives by educating people to have a healthier relationship with food! I feel that we should approach our food choices from a place of how does this serve my health!  Nothing is off the table in my opinion and food is meant to be enjoyed with the approach that food is fuel and medicine for our mind and bodies!   

I have a strong passion for Self Care and I feel we must take care of ourselves first to be able to take the best care of others! I like to echo this approach in my professional life too, showing up as the best coach!   I look forward to sharing my energy and definitely my humour and pure joy for life ! I feel  fitness should be FUN ! The  gym is where I love to turn UP the FUN volume ! I believe we should all strive to do what serves for us to live our best lives and have the best time doing  it!   At the end of the day we must live with a grateful heart acknowledging all that we ARE  and CAN be, along with the people in our lives!    



“Show up for your life and watch the MAGIC happen!”
